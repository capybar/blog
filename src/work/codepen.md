I completed  FreeCodeCamp's [Responsive Web Design Certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/capybar/responsive-web-design) while furloughed during the Pandemic and posted all of my assignments on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/smolcodes/pens/).

Fake home page and membership join page for Animorphs

I was obsessed with Animorphs.

The goal was to make these pages using semantic HTML and also responsive. Freom a design perspective I wanted to challenge myself with using web safe colors. I based the color scheme off of the default colors for link and link visited. The fonts chosen were supposed to emulate the 90's interpreation of future aesthetics and is also supposed to harkin back to the type choices from the book series.

Codepen also includes my experiments with CSS art and keyframes.
