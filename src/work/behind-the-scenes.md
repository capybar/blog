I create templates for the popular microblogging site Tumblr. These templates offer many 
customization options so the user doesn't need to need to know any coding skills to taylor
a template to their personal taste.

Most of these templates are free, responsive, have a commenting system and are SEO friendly.
The newer templates are also accessible.
