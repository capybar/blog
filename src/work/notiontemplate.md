I make fun and useful Notion templates to help you stay on track with school, learn a language or keep track of your pet rocks.

## Semester At a Glance

A template with everything you need to succeed for the semester.

This is the template I wish I had when I was in college. It's not really focused on grades or metrics rather it is a repository to keep all pertitnent imformation at your fingertips. It starts with immediate need to know information like where and when your classes are and ends with longer term important necessities like having a place to organize sholarschips and internships, along with a page to keep track of your college financiels.
