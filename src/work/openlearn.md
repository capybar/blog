This is a personal site used to log my progress learning the latest in web design. It has experimental projects like [cat icons](https://smolnotes.netlify.app/healyicons/) and [notes on Java](https://smolnotes.netlify.app/tag/java/). This site is mainly made to help future me but if it helps others, that would be nice too.
