>  To Love Another Person is to see the Face of God

Probably the first thing you ought to know about me is that Les Miserables is my favorite musical.

### About the Web Designer

I'm a coffee making web designer. I started learning in high school [with this book by Jennifer N. Robbings](https://www.learningwebdesign.com/). And with [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/). Back then, I used tables to create layouts. Wah~~. Some time around then I also attempted to make DeviantArt journal skins but couldn't afford a premium account. Around the beginning of college, I got a Tumblr. That's when my front end interests really took off. I [learned](https://buildthemes.tumblr.com/) how to make themes. The themes I've created have been used over 8,000 times!

I didn't start to seriously take front end web developement as a field I'd like to be a part of until this year! 

I recently learned [11ty](https://piccalil.li/course/learn-eleventy-from-scratch/) and am currently learning SASS as well as JavaScript and design systems. I'm also learning and have huge ineterest in accessibility.

### About the Coffee Drinker

Aside from web design, I'm a huge coffee fan and am technically [a coffee master](https://www.starbucks.co.th/coffeehouse/coffeemaster-program). I prefer light roast coffee, especially ones that are fruity or nutty. The Chemex makes delicious coffee and I recommend you go for mesh filters if you're trying to reduce your carbon foot print.

I also like to say I'm going to run but never actually do it.. And sometimes I play video games, but only ones like Portal, Journey and Monument Valley because speed and reflex are foreign concepts.
