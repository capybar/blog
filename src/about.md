Hi! I am a designer in upstate New York who likes making silly things for the web. Currently I'm fumbing around with 11ty and forever making Tumblr themes. I care about accsibility, funtionality and design in that order. I am always seeking new ways to improve my craft. Althugh I've been making Tumblr themes since 2013, I didn't start to sit down and seriously learn web developement (outside of Tumblr) until I was temporarily off of work for a few months mid 2020.

Web designing aside, I also enjoy reading, watching movies and playing the occasional video games. You can read my thoughts on them [on my personal blog](https://smolnotes.netlify.app/media/). I also enjoy learning about coffee, running and visiting new places.
