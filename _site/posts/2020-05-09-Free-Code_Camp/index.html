<h2><span>Complexity is Sometimes the Problem</span></h2>

<p>A few months ago I decided to give <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a> (FCC) a go. As of submitting this post, I'm basically done with the Responsive Webdesign Certificate. I already knew the majority of this stuff way before FCC, however I still got a lot out of this, especially the projects. The most valuable lesson and challenge is that of using only what you need.</p>
<p>The Tribute page gets bad rep for not requiring much. I saw this as an opportunity to try to use as much newness that I didn't know about prior to FCC. You really can create an entire web page with almost no <code>div</code> tags.</p>
<p>My CSS usually balloons to over 800 lines of code but this page? 64! And a huge part of this was because of the semantic HTML. It was easier to see how inheritance works once the divs weren't mysteries. I opted against using front end frameworks and the tiny bit of javascript that I knew because the purpose of this and all things is not to race ahead but to make the most of what you're learning.</p>
<p>You can view all my FCC projects on <a href="https://codepen.io/smolcodes">Codepen</a></p>
